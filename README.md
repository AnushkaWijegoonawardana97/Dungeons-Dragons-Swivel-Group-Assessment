## Setup

Followig are the requirements to run this project:

- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Node.js
- Code Editor
- Web Browser

## How To Run Locally

To run a React project that you've cloned from a repository locally on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Use Git to clone the React project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Use the following command, replacing `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnushkaWijegoonawardana97/Dungeons-Dragons-Swivel-Group-Assessment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:

   Change your working directory to the cloned project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Dungeons-Dragons-Swivel-Group-Assessment/dungeons-and-dragons
   ```

   Replace `my-react-project` with the name of the cloned project folder.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   In the project directory, you'll typically find a `package.json` file that lists the project's dependencies. To install these dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install all the required packages specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open your React app in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

5. **Make Changes**:

   You can now make changes to the cloned React project's source code. As you save changes, the development server will automatically reload your app in the browser, allowing you to see the results in real-time.

6. **Stop the Development Server**:

   To stop the development server and exit the development mode, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal. You'll be prompted to confirm the termination.

That's it! You've successfully cloned and run a React project locally on your computer. You can now work on the project, make changes, and test it on your local machine as needed.
